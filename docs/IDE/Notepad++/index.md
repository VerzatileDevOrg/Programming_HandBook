Notepad++ is a free and open-source text and source code editor for Windows. It is extremely lightweight and is very useful for quick code edits, psuedocoding, or note taking. Notepad++ has a wide support for a wide variety of programming languages. Itsupports syntax highlighting and folding for programming languages (e.g., C++, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript). The highlighting feature makes the code more readable by coloring different parts of the syntax, while folding allows users to collapse sections of code to make it easier to manage large files.

It's worth knowing that Notepad++ is primarily a text editor. It does not come with built-in support for compiling or debugging code. Users will need to use external compilers and debuggers, which can be less convenient than integrated development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio, that provide these tools out of the box. Unlike full-fledged IDEs, Notepad++ also lacks features like project management, integrated version control, and direct execution of code.
This doesn't make it any less useful!

To use notepad, simply download it from the link above, and then install it. Run it and start writing! No other nonsense involved!
