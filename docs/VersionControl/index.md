======================

Version control is a fundemental part of development, which gives a chance to see the history of previous commits, avoiding issues that might be pushed to the main available branch to avoid corruption and a loss of data. It stands as a cornerstone for collaboration and ensures the integrity of codebases. The main practise of version control is to practise tracking and managing its changes to the softwares codebase, while helping the developers to revise current and past changes to its source code to aid in debugging and rebuilding.

## What is it?

At its core, version control is a system that manages changes to documents, programs, or any set of files over time. It enables multiple contributors to work on a project simultaneously, keeping track of every modification, addition, or deletion made to the files. This ensures that developers can revert to previous versions if necessary, compare changes, and collaborate seamlessly.

## Use

Version control systems find applications across various domains, including software development, document management. In software development, version control is indispensable, allowing developers to coordinate, maintain code quality, and deploy updates efficiently. It provides a structured framework for managing different branches of development, facilitating parallel development of features and bug fixes. Fosters accountability by attributing changes to specific contributors, enabling effective code review processes.

## History

1. Manual Methods (1950s - 1960s)

    - Programmers manually labeled physical copies of code with version numbers.
2. Source Code Control System (SCCS) (1972)

    - Marc Rochkind develops SCCS at Bell Labs, one of the earliest centralized version control systems.
    -SCCS allows tracking changes and reverting to previous versions but operates on a centralized model.
3. Concurrent Versions System (CVS) (1990s)

    - CVS, an open-source version control system, is developed by Dick Grune and others.
    - Introduces features like branching and merging, facilitating collaboration among distributed teams.
4. Subversion (SVN) (2000s)

    - SVN emerges as a successor to CVS, addressing many of its deficiencies.
    - Introduces improvements like atomic commits, versioned directories, and better support for binary files.
    - Maintains a centralized architecture, posing scalability and availability challenges for distributed teams.
5. Dawn of Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) (Mid-2000s)

    - Git and Mercurial gain traction as distributed version control systems.
    - Offer a decentralized model, enabling every user to have a complete copy of the repository.
    - Facilitates offline work and faster operations.
6. Git Revolution (2005)

    - Linus Torvalds creates Git for managing the Linux kernel development.
    - Emphasizes speed, data integrity, and branching flexibility.
    - Empowers individuals and teams to collaborate seamlessly, leading to widespread adoption.
7. Mercurial and Beyond (2005)

    - Mercurial is launched as a notable alternative to Git.
    - Developed with a decentralized architecture similar to Git.
    - Continues to evolve with ongoing development efforts focused on performance enhancements and usability improvements.
