## What is Dart?

Dart is a client-optimized programming language for apps on multiple platforms. It is developed by Google and is used to build mobile, desktop, server, and web applications. Dart is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax. It supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, generics, and optional typing.

### 1) Object-Oriented

- Dart is an object-oriented language, which means that everything in Dart is an object.
- Objects are instances of classes, which are blueprints for creating objects.

### 2) Class-Based

- Dart is a class-based language, which means that all objects are created from classes.
- Classes are used to define the structure and behavior of objects.

### 3) Garbage-Collected

- Dart is a garbage-collected language, which means that the Dart VM automatically reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use.
- This allows developers to focus on writing code instead of worrying about memory management.

## Examples

Here are some simple example problems that explore making a coffee. Here is some example dart code:

```dart
class CoffeeMaker {
  void makeCoffee() {
    grindCoffeeBeans();
    brewCoffee();
    pourInCup();
    addCondiments();
  }

  void grindCoffeeBeans() {
    print('Grinding coffee beans');
  }

  void brewCoffee() {
    print('Brewing coffee');
  }

  void pourInCup() {
    print('Pouring coffee into cup');
  }

  void addCondiments() {
    print('Adding condiments');
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Dart is a powerful programming language that can be used to build mobile, desktop, server, and web applications. It is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax.
