HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It provides the structure and layout of a webpage by using a system of tags and attributes to define elements and their relationships.

1. **Markup Language:**

   - HTML is a markup language, meaning it uses tags to define elements within a document.
   - Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and are used to indicate the beginning and end of elements.

2. **Structure:**

   - HTML documents are structured as a hierarchy of elements, with each element representing a different part of the document.
   - Elements can be nested within other elements, creating a tree-like structure.

3. **Content:**

   - HTML supports various types of content, including text, images, videos, links, forms, and more.
   - Content is placed within the appropriate HTML elements using tags, such as;
     -    ```<p>``` for paragraphs, 
     -  ```<img>``` for images, 
     -  ```<video>``` for videos, 
     -  ```<a>``` for links, 
     -  ```<form>``` for forms.
  

4. **Attributes:**

   - HTML elements can have attributes, which provide additional information about the element.
   - Attributes are added to the opening tag of an element and are used to modify the element's behavior or appearance.

## Examples

Here's an example of HTML code that creates a simple webpage with a heading, paragraph, and an image:

{: .code title="Example"}

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Programming Handbook</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to the Programming Handbook</h1>

    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>

    <img src="example.jpg" alt="An example image" />
  </body>
</html>
```
